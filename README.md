# Rank-Codes-decoding
 Some binaries that performs the decoding for rank metric codes

The first algorithm, the function `decoding_Massey`, uses a generalization of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for the Rank metric. It works only for MRD codes, that for this metric have a partilcular construction.
The main reference for the code was the article where it was proposed:
Richter, Gerd and Simon Plass. *Error and Erasure Decoding of Rank-Codes with a Modified Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm.* (2004).
